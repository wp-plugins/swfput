"\t\t\t\tHopefully, much of the SWFPut shortcode form,\n"
"\t\t\t\tor \"metabox,\" is self-explanatory.\n"
"\t\t\t\tThere is more detailed documentation\n"
"\t\t\t\tas HTML\n"
"\t\t\t\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>,\n"

"\t\t\t\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThere is one important restriction on the form's\n"
"\t\t\t\ttext entry fields. The values may not have any\n"
"\t\t\t\tASCII '&quot;' (double quote) characters. Hopefully\n"
"\t\t\t\tthat will not be a problem.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThese form items probably need explanation:\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h6>URLs for alternate HTML5 video</h6>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThis text field accepts alternatives for non-flash\n"
"\t\t\t\tbrowsers, if recent enough to provide HTML5 video.\n"
"\t\t\t\tThe current state of affairs with HTML5 video will\n"
"\t\t\t\trequire three transcodings of the material if you\n"
"\t\t\t\twant broad browser support; moreover, the supported\n"
"\t\t\t\t\"container\" formats -- .webm, .ogg, and .mp4 --\n"
"\t\t\t\tmight contain different audio and video types (\"codecs\")\n"
"\t\t\t\tand only some of these will be supported by various\n"
"\t\t\t\tbrowsers.\n"
"\t\t\t\tUsers not already familiar with this topic will need\n"
"\t\t\t\tto do enough research to make the preceding statements\n"
"\t\t\t\tclear.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThe text field will accept any number of URLs, which\n"
"\t\t\t\tmust be separated by '|'. Each URL <em>may</em>\n"
"\t\t\t\tbe appended with a mime-type + codecs argument,\n"
"\t\t\t\tseparated from the URL by '?'. Whitespace around\n"
"\t\t\t\tthe separators is accepted and stripped-off. Please\n"
"\t\t\t\tnote that the argument given should <em>not</em>\n"
"\t\t\t\tinclude \"type=\" or the quotes: give only the\n"
"\t\t\t\tstatement that should appear within the quotes.\n"
"\t\t\t\tFor example:</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<blockquote><code>\n"
"\t\t\t\tvids/gato.mp4?video/mp4 | vids/gato.webm ? video/webm; "
"codecs=vp8,vorbis|vids/gato.ogv?video/ogg; codecs='theora, vorbis'\n"
"\t\t\t\t</code></blockquote>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tIn the example, where two codecs are specified there is\n"
"\t\t\t\tno space after the comma, or the two codecs are\n"
"\t\t\t\tenclosed in <em>single</em> quotes.\n"
"\t\t\t\tMany online examples\n"
"\t\t\t\tshow a space after the comma without the quotes,\n"
"\t\t\t\tbut some older\n"
"\t\t\t\tversions of <em>Firefox</em> will reject that\n"
"\t\t\t\tusage, so the space after the comma is best left out.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h6>Use initial image as non-flash alternate</h6>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThis checkbox, if enabled (it is, by default) will\n"
"\t\t\t\tuse the \"initial image file\" that may be specified\n"
"\t\t\t\tfor the flash player in an 'img' element\n"
"\t\t\t\tthat the visitor's browser should display if flash\n"
"\t\t\t\tis not available.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tIf alternate HTML5 video was specified, that will\n"
"\t\t\t\tremain the first alternate display, and the initial\n"
"\t\t\t\timage should display if neither flash or HTML5 video\n"
"\t\t\t\tare available.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThere is one additional consideration for this image:\n"
"\t\t\t\tthe 'img' element is given the width and height\n"
"\t\t\t\tspecified in the form for the flash player, and the\n"
"\t\t\t\tvisitor's browser will scale the image in both\n"
"\t\t\t\tdimensions, possibly causing the image to be\n"
"\t\t\t\t'stretched' or 'squeezed'. (That is not a problem\n"
"\t\t\t\tin the flash player, as it is coded to display the\n"
"\t\t\t\tinitial image proportionally.)\n"
"\t\t\t\tThe image proportions are restored with\n"
"\t\t\t\t<em>JavaScript</em>, but only  if scripts are\n"
"\t\t\t\tnot disabled in the visitor's browser.\n"
"\t\t\t\tTherefore, it is a\n"
"\t\t\t\tgood idea to prepare images to have the expected\n"
"\t\t\t\t<em>pixel</em> aspect ratio\n"
"\t\t\t\t(top/bottom or left/right tranparent\n"
"\t\t\t\tareas might be one solution).\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<h6>Mobile width</h6>\n"
"\t\t\t\tThis input field appears just below the\n"
"\t\t\t\tpixel dimensions fields. If this value is\n"
"\t\t\t\tgreater than zero, and a mobile browser is\n"
"\t\t\t\tdetected, then this width will be used with\n"
"\t\t\t\ta proportional height according to the\n"
"\t\t\t\tregular pixel dimensions. This might be\n"
"\t\t\t\tuseful when, for example, sidebar content\n"
"\t\t\t\tactually appears below main content due to\n"
"\t\t\t\tthe mobile browser's small size (theme support\n"
"\t\t\t\tmay be necessary to see this behavior). This\n"
"\t\t\t\tis probably most useful for video widgets placed\n"
"\t\t\t\ton a sidebar, but please experiment.\n"
"\t\t\t\tThe default value for this field, 0,\n"
"\t\t\t\tdisables this feature, and it has no effect if\n"
"\t\t\t\ta mobile browser is not detected.\n"
"\t\t\t\t</p>\n"
