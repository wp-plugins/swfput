"\t\tHopefully, much of the SWFPut setup form\n"
"\t\tis self-explanatory.\n"
"\t\tThere is more detailed documentation as HTML\n"
"\t\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>,\n"
"\t\tor as a PDF file\n"
"\t\t<a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">here (in a new tab)</a>.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tThere is one important restriction on the form's\n"
"\t\ttext entry fields. The values may not have any\n"
"\t\tASCII '&quot;' (double quote) characters. Hopefully\n"
"\t\tthat will not be a problem.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tThe following items probably need explanation:\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t<h6>Flash or HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs</h6>\n"
"\t\tNear the top of the form, after the \"Caption\" field,\n"
"\t\ta text entry field named\n"
"\t\t\"Flash video URL or media library ID\" appears.\n"
"\t\tThis is for the video file that the flash player\n"
"\t\twill use. You may enter a URL by hand (which may\n"
"\t\tbe off-site), or make a selection from the next\n"
"\t\ttwo items,\n"
"\t\t\"Select flash video URL from uploads directory\" and\n"
"\t\t\"Select ID for flash video from media library.\"\n"
"\t\tThe first of these two holds a selection of files\n"
"\t\tfound under your <code>wp-content/uploads</code>\n"
"\t\tdirectory with a FLV or MP4 extension. Files\n"
"\t\tare placed under this directory when you use the\n"
"\t\t<em>WordPress</em> media library, but you may also\n"
"\t\tplace files there 'by hand' using, for example,\n"
"\t\tftp or ssh or any suitable utility (placing files\n"
"\t\tin a subdirectory is a good idea).\n"
"\t\tIn fact, uploading video files 'by hand' might\n"
"\t\tbe the easiest way to bypass size limits that\n"
"\t\treject large video file uploads through the\n"
"\t\tmedia library interface. The next field\n"
"\t\thas a selection of media files with a\n"
"\t\t<em>WordPress</em> 'attachment id' and so it\n"
"\t\tprovides only those files uploaded to the media\n"
"\t\tlibrary (with a FLV or MP4 extension).\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tAfter those three fields for flash video, there is\n"
"\t\t\"HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs\" which,\n"
"\t\tlike the flash text entry, is followed by selections\n"
"\t\tof files and 'attachment id's. These show files\n"
"\t\twith MP4 or OGG or OGV or WEBM extensions. As the\n"
"\t\tfield names suggest, these are for the HTML5 video\n"
"\t\tplayer. An important difference is that when you\n"
"\t\tmake a selection, the entry field is appended,\n"
"\t\trather than replaced, with a '|' separator.\n"
"\t\tThe HTML5 video entry field can take more than one\n"
"\t\tvalue, as explained below.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tIt is not necessary to fill both the flash and HTML5\n"
"\t\tvideo URL fields, but it is a good idea to do so\n"
"\t\tif you can prepare the video in the needed formats.\n"
"\t\tIf you specify only one type, the other type of\n"
"\t\tvideo player is not produced in the page code.\n"
"\t\tIf you do specify URLs for both flash and HTML5 video,\n"
"\t\tthen the page code will have one as primary content,\n"
"\t\tand the other as \"fallback\" content. Fallback content\n"
"\t\tis shown by the web-browser only when the primary\n"
"\t\tcontent cannot be shown. For example, if flash is\n"
"\t\tprimary content, but you have specified HTML5 content\n"
"\t\ttoo, then a visitor to your site who does not\n"
"\t\thave a flash plugin would see the HTML5 video player\n"
"\t\tif the browser supports it.\n"
"\t\t(Mobile browsers are less likely to have a flash\n"
"\t\tplugin than desktop-type browsers.)\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tBy default, flash is made primary content with\n"
"\t\tHTML5 as fallback. You may make HTML5 be primary\n"
"\t\tand flash be fallback with the \"HTML5 video primary\"\n"
"\t\toption on the settings page. (Go to the \"Settings\"\n"
"\t\tmenu and select \"SWFPut Plugin\" for the settings page.)\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tThe current state of affairs with HTML5 video will\n"
"\t\trequire three transcodings of the video if you\n"
"\t\twant broad browser support; moreover, the supported\n"
"\t\t\"container\" formats -- .webm, .ogg/.ogv, and .mp4 --\n"
"\t\tmight contain different audio and video types (\"codecs\")\n"
"\t\tand only some of these will be supported by various\n"
"\t\tbrowsers.\n"
"\t\tUsers not already familiar with this topic should\n"
"\t\tdo enough research to make the preceding statements\n"
"\t\tclear.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tThe \"HTML5 video URLs\" field\n"
"\t\twill accept any number of URLs, which\n"
"\t\tmust be separated by '|'. Each URL <em>may</em>\n"
"\t\tbe appended with a mime-type + codecs argument,\n"
"\t\tseparated from the URL by '?'. Whitespace around\n"
"\t\tthe separators is accepted and stripped-off. Please\n"
"\t\tnote that the argument given should <em>not</em>\n"
"\t\tinclude \"type=\" or quotes: give only the\n"
"\t\tstatement that should appear within the quotes.\n"
"\t\tFor example:</p>\n"
"\t\t<blockquote><code>\n"
"\t\tvids/gato.mp4 ? video/mp4 | vids/gato.webm ? video/webm; "
"codecs=vp8,vorbis | vids/gato.ogv?video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis\n"
"\t\t</code></blockquote>\n"
"\t\t<p>\n"
"\t\tIn the example, where two codecs are specified there is\n"
"\t\tno space after the comma.\n"
"\t\tSome online examples\n"
"\t\tshow a space after the comma,\n"
"\t\tbut some older\n"
"\t\tversions of <em>Firefox</em> will reject that\n"
"\t\tusage, so the space after the comma is best left out.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t<h6>Use initial image as no-video alternate</h6>\n"
"\t\tThis checkbox, if enabled (it is, by default) will\n"
"\t\tuse the \"initial image file\" that may be specified\n"
"\t\tfor the video player in an 'img' element\n"
"\t\tthat the visitor's browser might display if video\n"
"\t\tis not available.\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\tThere is one additional consideration for this image:\n"
"\t\tthe 'img' element is given the width and height\n"
"\t\tspecified in the form for the flash player, and the\n"
"\t\tvisitor's browser will scale the image in both\n"
"\t\tdimensions, possibly causing the image to be\n"
"\t\t'stretched' or 'squeezed'.\n"
"\t\tThe image proportions are restored with\n"
"\t\t<em>JavaScript</em>, but only if scripts are\n"
"\t\tnot disabled in the visitor's browser.\n"
"\t\tTherefore, it is a\n"
"\t\tgood idea to prepare images to have the expected\n"
"\t\t<em>pixel</em> aspect ratio\n"
"\t\t(top/bottom or left/right tranparent\n"
"\t\tareas might be one solution).\n"
"\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t<h6>Mobile width</h6>\n"
"\t\tThis input field appears just below the\n"
"\t\tpixel dimensions fields. If this value is\n"
"\t\tgreater than zero, and a mobile browser is\n"
"\t\tdetected, then this width will be used with\n"
"\t\ta proportional height according to the\n"
"\t\tregular pixel dimensions. This might be\n"
"\t\tuseful when, for example, sidebar content\n"
"\t\tactually appears below main content due to\n"
"\t\tthe mobile browser's small size (theme support\n"
"\t\tmay be necessary to see this behavior). This\n"
"\t\tis probably most useful for video widgets placed\n"
"\t\ton a sidebar, but please experiment.\n"
"\t\tThe default value for this field, 0,\n"
"\t\tdisables this feature, and it has no effect if\n"
"\t\ta mobile browser is not detected.\n"

"These options control video placement.\n"
"\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\tThe first option, \"HTML5 video primary,\"\n"
"\t\t\tmakes HTML5 video be placed as\n"
"\t\t\tprimary (rather than fallback) content. If this\n"
"\t\t\tis selected then flash video\n"

"\t\t\ttypes specified, it probably will\n"
"\t\t\t<em>not</em> fallback to flash video. That is,\n"
"\t\t\tplacing flash video as fallback is only useful\n"
"\t\t\tfor browsers that do not support the video\n"
"\t\t\telement. At this time the major graphical browsers\n"
"\t\t\tall support the HTML5 video element, so using this\n"
"\t\t\toption is effectively disabling the flash video\n"
"\t\t\t(except when HTML5 video was not specified at all).\n"
"\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\tBy default flash is primary and HTML5 video\n"
"\t\t\tis fallback content. The flash plugin seems to be\n"
"\t\t\tlosing favor (although it remains a more consistent\n"
"\t\t\tand simple engine for a video player), and for some\n"
"\t\t\tplatforms the plugin is not available. Even where available,\n"
"\t\t\tflash might be disabled by default by some browsers, or\n"
"\t\t\tthe browser might\n"
"\t\t\trequire user approval before flash is allowed to run.\n"
"\t\t\t</p><p>\n"
"\t\t\tNote that at present the major graphical browsers\n"
"\t\t\tdo <em>not</em> all support the same set of video\n"
"\t\t\ttypes for their HTML5 video players.\n"
"\t\t\tTo reliably use HTML5 video as primary content,\n"
"\t\t\tyou will need to prepare the video in .MP4, .OGG (.OGV),\n"
"\t\t\tand .WEBM container formats with suitable codecs.\n"
"\t\t\t(The posts/pages editor page has a help button which\n"

"\t\t\tGenerally, if you can provide the several formats needed\n"
"\t\t\tfor good HTML5 support, using the \"HTML5 video primary\"\n"
