"\t<em>WordPress</em> media library, but you may also\n"
"\tplace files there 'by hand' using, for example,\n"
"\tftp or ssh or any suitable utility (placing files\n"
"\tin a subdirectory is a good idea).\n"
"\tIn fact, uploading video files 'by hand' might\n"
"\tbe the easiest way to bypass size limits that\n"
"\treject large video file uploads through the\n"
"\tmedia library interface. The next field\n"
"\thas a selection of media files with a\n"

"\tAfter those three fields for flash video, there is\n"
"\t\"HTML5 video URLs or media library IDs\" which,\n"
"\tlike the flash text entry, is followed by selections\n"
"\tof files and 'attachment id's. These show files\n"
"\twith MP4 or OGG or OGV or WEBM extensions. As the\n"
"\tfield names suggest, these are for the HTML5 video\n"
"\tplayer. An important difference is that when you\n"
"\tmake a selection, the entry field is appended,\n"
"\trather than replaced, with a '|' separator.\n"
"\tThe HTML5 video entry field can take more than one\n"
"\tvalue, as explained below.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tIt is not necessary to fill both the flash and HTML5\n"
"\tvideo URL fields, but it is a good idea to do so\n"
"\tif you can prepare the video in the needed formats.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tBy default, HTML5 is made primary content with\n"
"\tflash as fallback. You may make flash be primary\n"
"\tand HTML5 be fallback with the \"HTML5 video primary\"\n"
"\toption on the settings page. (Go to the \"Settings\"\n"
"\tmenu and select \"SWFPut Plugin\" for the settings page.)\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe current state of affairs with HTML5 video will\n"
"\trequire three transcodings of the video if you\n"
"\twant broad browser support; moreover, the supported\n"
"\t\"container\" formats -- .webm, .ogg/.ogv, and .mp4 --\n"
"\tmight contain different audio and video types (\"codecs\")\n"
"\tand only some of these will be supported by various\n"
"\tbrowsers.\n"
"\tUsers not already familiar with this topic should\n"
"\tdo enough research to make the preceding statements\n"
"\tclear.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThe \"HTML5 video URLs\" field\n"
"\twill accept any number of URLs, which\n"
"\tmust be separated by '|'. Each URL <em>may</em>\n"
"\tbe appended with a mime-type + codecs argument,\n"
"\tseparated from the URL by '?'. Whitespace around\n"
"\tthe separators is accepted and stripped-off. Please\n"
"\tnote that the argument given should <em>not</em>\n"
"\tinclude \"type=\" or quotes: give only the\n"
"\tstatement that should appear within the quotes.\n"
"\tFor example:</p>\n"
"\t<blockquote><code>\n"
"\tvids/gato.mp4 ? video/mp4 | vids/gato.webm ? video/webm; codecs=vp8,"
"vorbis | vids/gato.ogv?video/ogg; codecs=theora,vorbis\n"
"\t</code></blockquote>\n"
"\t<p>\n"
"\tIn the example, where two codecs are specified there is\n"
"\tno space after the comma.\n"
"\tSome online examples, and even HTML specifaction pages,\n"
"\tshow a space after the comma,\n"
"\tbut browsers might reject that\n"
"\tusage, so SWFPut will normalize the codecs argument.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h3>Use initial image as no-video alternate</h3>\n"
"\tThis checkbox, if enabled (it is, by default) will\n"
"\tuse the \"initial image file\" that may be specified\n"
"\tfor the video player in an 'img' element\n"
"\tthat the visitor's browser might display if video\n"
"\tis not available.\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\tThere is one additional consideration for this image:\n"
"\tthe 'img' element is given the width and height\n"
"\tspecified in the form for the flash player, and the\n"
"\tvisitor's browser will scale the image in both\n"
"\tdimensions, possibly causing the image to be\n"
"\t'stretched' or 'squeezed'.\n"
"\tThe image proportions are restored with\n"
"\t<em>JavaScript</em>, but only if scripts are\n"
"\tnot disabled in the visitor's browser.\n"
"\tTherefore, it is a\n"
"\tgood idea to prepare images to have the expected\n"
"\t<em>pixel</em> aspect ratio\n"
"\t(top/bottom or left/right tranparent\n"
"\tareas might be one solution).\n"
"\t</p><p>\n"
"\t<h3>Mobile width</h3>\n"
"\tThis input field appears just below the\n"
"\tpixel dimensions fields. If this value is\n"
"\tgreater than zero, and a mobile browser is\n"
"\tdetected, then this width will be used with\n"
"\ta proportional height according to the\n"
"\tregular pixel dimensions. This might be\n"
"\tuseful when, for example, sidebar content\n"
"\tactually appears below main content due to\n"
"\tthe mobile browser's small size (theme support\n"
"\tmay be necessary to see this behavior). This\n"
"\tis probably most useful for video widgets placed\n"
"\ton a sidebar, but please experiment.\n"
"\tThe default value for this field, 0,\n"
"\tdisables this feature, and it has no effect if\n"
"\ta mobile browser is not detected.\n"
