SWFPut provides a flash video player for posts and pages, and a widget, and forms to configure display and video playback.

== Description ==

SWFPut helps place flash video within posts, on pages,
and in the sidebar or other widget areas (by providing a
widget). Video objects are placed and configured with
forms, so the user doesn't need to learn a shortcode or
maintain one with hand-editing. A shortcode will be visible
in the editor for posts and pages; it can be considered a
visual indication that the video is in place. The widget
does not use a shortcode. If you don't know what a shortcode
is, that's okay, SWFPut does not require you to know.

Here are some features of SWFPut to consider if you wonder
whether it will suit your purpose:

*	SWFPut includes and uses its own
	video player program (that runs in the
	web browser's flash plugin).
	It is not designed to work
	with other flash video player programs.

*	SWFPut works directly with media file (.flv, .mp4)
	URLs; that is, SWFPut does *not* embed
	the video players of providers such as YouTube or Vimeo.
	SWFPut is for video files which are accessible by URL,
	whether hosted at your site or off-site.
	The setup form provides two media lists:
	one offers media files (.flv, .mp4) that you can
	upload with the WordPress 'Add Media' feature,
	and one offer media files (.flv, .mp4) that are
	found in a search under the "uploads" directory
	(this allows you upload media files without using
	the WordPress PHP upload, which might have a size
	limit too low for audio/visual material). Of course,
	a URL may be placed directly in a text input field.

*	An initial image (sometimes called a "poster") that
	will display until the play button is clicked can
	(and should) be provided. The setup form provides for
	this in the same way as described above.

*	SWFPut should not interfere with the appearance of
	a site: a video is presented much like an image
	(such as .png or .jpg) is, with the same sort of
	border and optional caption.

*	SWFPut allows you to set the size of the
	video player window. Generally, you would want the
	aspect ratio of the window to match that of the video
	(but that is not required). The size of the player
	window does not need to match the display size of
	the video frames; the video will be scaled to fit
	the player window, maintaining the video aspect ratio
	as set by you or as implied by the width and height.
	Note that the widths of the page columns set by
	your theme's CSS limit the width of the player window.

*	SWFPut allows you to set the display aspect ratio
	for the video. Some video is 'anamorphic' in that
	the pixel width and height do not match the intended
	proportion of display width and height. You might
	film your child's school play as 16:9 'widescreen'
	but use a space saving feature of your recorder that
	saves the video at 480x360 (which is not 16:9). You can
	set SWFPut to display the video at the intended 16:9
	aspect ratio. You may set any aspect ratio (make it
	distorted if you wish).

*	The core features of the flash video player program
	included with SWFPut have been verified to work with
	the Gnash free-software browser plugin, which is good
	because non-free binary-only software is bad. (At the
	time of this writing, Gnash does not handle the MP4
	video container format, so it is preferable that you
	prepare video in the FLV container, even using the
	h.264 and AAC codecs. Of course, you may use MP4 if
	you must.)

*	The flash video player program included with SWFPut
	is written and compiled with the *Ming* PHP extension,
	and the code is included, so you may modify the player.

*	SWFPut does not add any JavaScript to the pages
	generated for your visitors, which might be helpful if
	you try to keep your pages useful to those who disable
	JavaScript in their browsers. (Such visitors might need to
	explicitly enable the flash web browser plugin, but that is
	another, unavoidable, issue.) JavaScript is only used in the
	administrative interface for the forms and manipulation of
	shortcodes in the editor.

== Installation ==

SWFPut is installed through the WordPress administrative interface.

1. Fetch the SWFPut zip file; save it on your computer

1. Log in at your WordPress site

1. Select 'Plugins -> Add New'

1. Select 'Upload'

1. Select 'Browse'

1. In your system's file selector, select the SWFPut zip file;
  select 'OK' or equivalent

1. Select 'Install Now'

1. Select 'Activate Plugin'

At this point "SWFlash Put" should be an entry on the plugins page.
The Settings menu should have an item "SWFPut Plugin".

If the above is not so, there is probably a problem at your site's
host; for example if the host is Unix system there is very likely
a problem with incorrect permissions metadata (mode) on a directory
such as wp-content/uploads, or an unsuitable user or group ownership
of (probably several) files and directories. This can be a frequent
problem if the host has PHP configured in "safe mode".

If the host is not a Unix system, I'm sorry to say I cannot help;
maybe your hosting provider can.

If the installation was successful, you should see a "SWFPut Flash Video"
widget under 'Appearance -> Widgets' and a form entitled
"SWFPut Flash Video Shortcode" on the posts and pages editing pages.

For additional help, you will find README* files (differing in format,
and excluding 'readme.txt', which is this file) that discuss the
flash video player in more detail.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this really a FAQ? =

At the time of this writing, 0 (zero) questions have
been asked, which implies that few have been asked
frequently. Until this becomes a true FAQ, it will
be used to answer questions that are merely anticipated,
as is common practice.

= Do I really need to understand "aspect ratio" and such-like? =

Probably not. In most case the width and height of the
video will match the intended display proportion.
"Anamorphic" video is not rare, but probably not too common
either. The author has seen videos on e.g., YouTube,
that are distorted by wrong display aspect ratio
(which is not YouTube's fault), but only a few.
If you find that your video looks squeezed or stretched,
you can always use a little trial & error with the display
aspect setting until it looks good.

What you *must* understand is that you *must* convert
video to the format (the type) that the web-browser plugin
can handle; namely, FLV or MP4. If you use a converter
program designed for non-experts, you won't need to
understand too many details. A web search should turn up
some converter programs that might be worth a try.

= Why doesn't SWFPut support HTML5 video? =

Because the author has decided that that would be
done best in a separate (but similar) plugin. The
author might write one, particularly if SWFPut generates
some interest.

The problem with including HTML5 video in the same
package is that HTML5 video in its current specification
does not provide features that SWFPut provides; for
example, HTML5 video will not scale video disproportionate
to the pixel width and height and will *only* scale video
(proportionally) to the width or height of the html video
element. (An insane JavaScript hack can create a not-displayed
video object and use a timeout callback at at least the video
frame rate to paint the current frame on a canvas with scaling
suitably calculated for an anamorphic video, but using this
method squanders the visitor's CPU, increases dropped frames,
has no full-screen mode, and provides no built in controls,
and is a bad idea that the author has looked into and
rejected.) There are other reasons, such as different
supported file formats.

Update 1 August 2013: WordPress 3.6 is released, with HTML5
video and audio support. That's another reason.

= Are you going to anticipate more questions? =

Maybe later.

== Screenshots ==

1. The SWFPut widget setup form (bottom).

2. The SWFPut posts/page setup form ('meta box') with the first
	section hidden.

3. The appearance of video placed by SWFPut (Twentyeleven theme
	with dark custom colors, sidebar on left), not yet playing.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.2 =
* Corrections in (vaguely distinguished)
	add_(action|filter) calls, according to tag used, checked against
	WP source (whether do_action() or apply_filters() is invoked
	for the tag in question).
* Changed JS unescape() to decodeURIComponent().
* Removed compiled README.{tty,tt8} from distribution.
* Changed 'wptexturize' to 'htmlentities' for paths and things that
	should not be pretty-pretty'd.
* Changed 'Tags:' in readme.txt (and stable, etc.).

= 1.0.1 =
* Maintenance.
* Editing and corrections in readme.txt.
* Behavior change: without initial image ('poster'), medium is no
	longer fetched automatically (without visitor play); was a
	misfeature that would simulate an initial image by pausing
	at a random point within first few seconds of the video, but
	the unsolicited download is a bad idea. (Might be an option
	in future.)

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0.2 =
BUG FIX: URLs with non-8-bit characters would be corrupted in form
	fields, causing not-found errors in the player: changed
	JS unescape() to decodeURIComponent(). (Feedback on non-UTF-8
	charsets would be welcome!)

= 1.0.1 =
This revision has one important change: a misfeature that would
	simulate an initial image (if one was not set) by pausing
	at a random point within first few seconds of the video, but
	causing an unsolicited download of the medium in order to do so,
	has been disabled.
