         SWFPut -- Flash Video Player Plugin for WordPress


                    Ed Hynan <edhynan@gmail.com>


              This  `README'  serves as the main documenta-
         tion for the SWFPut WordPress plugin, and  as  the
         conventional `README' as well.



    1.  What is it?

         SWFPut  is  a  plugin  for the popular WordPress weblog
    software. It provides a video player program for  the  flash
    plugin  and  the means to configure an instance with a video
    source and playback attributes.  There are two separate com-
    ponents:  the  flash  video player, and the WordPress plugin
    proper.  The video player is delivered to site  visitors  by
    the  plugin  in  the traditional <object ...> block with the
    necessary arguments. Flash video objects may  be  placed  in
    posts  and  pages,  or in the widget areas supported by your
    theme (i.e., the plugin includes a widget).  Video is placed
    in posts and pages with a shortcode; if you do not know what
    a shortcode is, or do not want to deal with them, that's  no
    problem.  (In fact, it is preferable that the shortcodes not
    be hand-edited, and they will not  be  discussed  in  detail
    here.)  The  plugin  adds  to the administrative interface a
    full featured form to setup and  add,  or  edit,  or  delete
    video objects, so the user does not need to be troubled with
    shortcodes (they will be visible in the editor; you will get
    used  to  them).   The flash video widget has a similar full
    featured form.

         The plugin does not add any  JavaScript  to  the  pages
    generated  for  your visitors, which might be helpful if you
    try  to  keep  your  pages  useful  to  those  who   disable
    JavaScript  in  their browsers. (Such visitors might need to
    explicitly enable the flash web browser plugin, but that  is
    another,  unavoidable,  issue.)   JavaScript  is used in the
    administrative interface for the forms and  manipulation  of
    shortcodes  in  the  editor;  but  of  course  you must have
    JavaScript enabled when you log in to your WordPress site --
    this does not affect your visitors.

         (Note  that  the  SWFPut video player has been coded to
    work well with the free Gnash web browser plugin, as well as
    the  closed  binary-only  proprietary version in common use.
    As of this writing, Gnash does not handle  MP4  files  well,
    even though it handles H.264 video and AAC audio if they are









                                 -2-


    in an FLV container file.)

    2.  Building From the Source

         SWFPut is distributed as a  ZIP  archive  prepared  for
    installation  on  a  WordPress  site with the "Add New" item
    under the "Plugins" menu.  Therefore, there is  no  need  to
    build the package before use.

         (You may skip forward to the Usage section if you don't
    intend to modify the player or plugin.)

         The  actual  plugin  is  composed  of  PHP  code,   and
    JavaScript  for  the  administrative  parts,  and neither of
    those requires compilation or link editing.  The flash video
    player  is  a compiled program, but binaries are included in
    the installable package so that use does not require  compi-
    lation  by  the user. Of course, the source code is included
    and the binaries may be built  if  necessary  (or  desired).
    Compiling the flash program will require the Ming PHP exten-
    sion. See  the  files  Makefile,  mingtest/mingput.php,  and
    mingtest/mainact.inc.php  if  you wish to learn to build the
    player.

         If you wish to change the JavaScript code, edit js/for-
    mxed.dev.js,  rather  than  js/formxed.js.   The  latter  is
    merely a `minified' version of the former; see Makefile.

         This file (README*) is built with the  GNU  roff  groff
    with ms macros; see docs/Makefile.

         The  Makefiles require a Unix-like or POSIX system. The
    default target builds as necessary and then creates the  ZIP
    file.

    3.  Usage

         A logged in session is assumed.

         SWFPut  installed will add an item under the "Settings"
    menu named "SWFPut Plugin". Selecting  that  should  produce
    the  plugin's  configuration  page.   The configuration page
    includes optional verbose  help,  and  so  it  will  not  be
    described here.

         When editing posts or pages, below the editor the plug-
    in will have placed an interactive form with the title "SWF-
    Put  Flash  Video Shortcode".  Directly under the title is a
    row of buttons.  Under the row of buttons, the bulk  of  the
    form  is  placed in three sections entitled "Media", "Dimen-
    sions", and "Behavior".  The title bar of each section has a
    button that will hide or show that section, which might help
    if the height of the form is greater than that the display.










                                 -3-


         3.1.  Form Buttons


         o    Fill form from editor: When  the  post  (or  page)
              already  contains  a  SWFPut  flash  video  object
              (i.e., shortcode), this will find it in the editor
              and  fill  the  form with its details.  A post may
              contain any number of  SWFPut  video  objects.  If
              there is more than one, then repeatedly using this
              button will cycle through each in turn.

         o    Replace current in editor: When the form has  been
              filled  with  the  details of a video object using
              "Fill form from editor" (described above),  or  if
              it contains the details of a new video object that
              has  just  been  added,  the  form  items  may  be
              changed,  and this button will edit the associated
              shortcode (video object) with the changes.

         o    Delete current in editor: As described  above  for
              "Replace  current  in  editor", except that rather
              than changing the details of the shortcode, it  is
              deleted.

         o    Place  new  in  editor: After making sure that the
              cursor (insertion point) in the editor is  at  the
              desired  position, and setting the form items, use
              this button to add a new shortcode (video).

         o    Reset default values:  Except  for  the  "Caption"
              text field, all form items are set to default val-
              ues, or cleared. It is  assumed  that  text  typed
              into  the  "Caption"  field  would be better main-
              tained by hand, so that field is not cleared.


         3.2.  Form Sections


         3.2.1.  Media

         o    Caption: A video object is set in  a  page  as  an
              image  would  be,  with  the  same  border, and an
              optional caption, which may be set here.  If  this
              field is left blank, there will be no caption.

         o    Url or media library ID: A fully qualified URL may
              be given here, or an ID valid  for  the  WordPress
              database.  Or more conveniently, this field may be
              set from the two drop-down lists  described  next.
              Acceptable  protocols  are  HTTP, HTTPS, and RTMP.
              Support for RTMP is only partial and very limited.
              See   "Playpath  (rtmp)"  below.  Acceptable  file
              (media)  types  are  FLV,  MP4  (video),  and  MP3









                                 -4-


              (audio)1.

         o    Url from uploads directory: This  is  a  drop-down
              list  from  which  the  "Url  or media library ID"
              field may be set. The WordPress uploads  directory
              is  searched  recursively  for files with the suf-
              fixes FLV, MP4, and MP3, and for  each  a  URL  is
              placed  in this list.  This has the advantage that
              it will find files added by hand (rather than with
              the  `add  media' interface) if they are placed in
              uploads or a directory under it.

         o    Select ID from media library: This is a  drop-down
              list  from  which  the  "Url  or media library ID"
              field may be set, as above,  with  the  difference
              that it searches the WordPress media database, and
              presents the suitable filenames their media IDs.

         o    Playpath (rtmp): If the "Url or media library  ID"
              field  is  given  an  RTMP  URL, the `playpath' is
              given here. Note that only the simplest RTMP  con-
              nections  are  supported: those requiring only the
              playpath.

         o    Url of initial image file (optional): An  HTTP  or
              HTTPS  URL  for  an image file may be placed here.
              When the player is loaded, if it  is  not  set  to
              play  on  load,  this image is displayed until the
              play button is invoked. Accepted image  types  are
              JPEG, PNG, and GIF, and SWF2.

         o    Load image from uploads directory: This is a drop-
              down list from which the  "Url  of  initial  image
              file  (optional)"  field may be set. The WordPress
              uploads  directory  is  searched  recursively  for
              files  with  the suffixes listed as acceptable for
              that field, and for each a URL is placed  in  this
              list.   This  has  the advantage that it will find
              files added by hand (rather  than  with  the  `add
              media' interface) if they are placed in uploads or
              a directory under it.

    -----------
      1 For MP3 files, you may try placing a video URL
    in the "Playpath (rtmp)" field to play along  with
    the  audio. If the video has an audio stream, that
    will mix in, so it should probably be a video only
    file. This is an experimental and unsupported fea-
    ture.
      2 SWF  files  may  be stills or animations. This
    type is a flash program that the flash web browser
    plugin  will  be executing, so, of course, it must
    not interfere with the SWFPut player.  Test  thor-
    oughly if this is used.









                                 -5-


         o    Load image ID from media library: This is a  drop-
              down  list  from  which  the "Url of initial image
              file (optional)" field may be set, as above,  with
              the  difference  that  it  searches  the WordPress
              media database, and presents  the  suitable  file-
              names their media IDs.

         o    Medium  is  audio:  To  determine  whether to play
              video or audio, the file suffix of the  medium  is
              checked.   If  the  file  suffix is not known, the
              medium is assumed to be video. If the medium is an
              mp3  audio file, but it does not have the MP3 suf-
              fix, check this.

         3.2.2.  Dimensions

         o    Pixel Width x Height: set  these  to  the  desired
              size  of  the player's embedded window.  This does
              not need to be the same as the display size of the
              video  to  be  played,  but the appearance will be
              best if the aspect of the player's display is  the
              same as the display aspect of the video. For exam-
              ple, if set for a video with a  size  of  400x300,
              then setting these to fields to 320x240 would look
              good (the width:height ratio is the same). In  any
              case,  the  player  will  scale  the  video to fit
              within its display, but it  maintains  the  aspect
              ratio,  so  horizontal  or vertical black (unused)
              areas will be visible if the aspect ratios do  not
              match.  It  is  also  important  to  note that the
              browser will (probably) honor a maximum width  for
              a  page column set in CSS, and force the browser's
              flash plugin to display at a  smaller  width  than
              the user specified.  For example, if you set these
              fields to 640x480, but the column in  which  posts
              appear has a width of 600, the display would be at
              600x480. In such a case, you might try 600x450  to
              maintain the aspect so that the video matches dis-
              play size.  The above assumes a  4:3  aspect;  you
              would use the correct numbers, of course.

         o    Auto  aspect:  This  enables a feature meant to be
              helpful when the video to  be  played  might  have
              been prepared as DVD-Video (NTSC or PAL) for stan-
              dard (non-widescreen) 4:3 display. Such video  has
              non-square  pixels;  i.e., its actual widthxheight
              does not match its intended display  aspect.  With
              this  check  enabled,  the video player will force
              display at 4:3 ratio if the video dimensions match
              one  of  the  DVD-Video  pixel  sizes. This is not
              suitable for widescreen DVD-Video, which  has  one
              of  the  expected  DVD-Video  pixel  sizes, but is
              meant to be displayed with a 16:9 aspect.










                                 -6-


         o    Display aspect: Set the  intended  display  aspect
              ratio in this field if you know that the video has
              non-square pixels. A value of  0  (zero)  disables
              this  field;  otherwise, a value may be given as a
              decimal number (e.g., 1.33333333) or  as  a  ratio
              using  `:'  or `x' or `/' as separator (e.g., 4:3,
              or 16x9, of 20/11, etc.--several other  characters
              will  also  be  accepted  as a separator, but it's
              sensible to use those listed here).

         o    Pixel aspect: Similar to "Display  aspect"  above,
              but  this  field  takes  the source (pixel) aspect
              ratio  rather  than  the  display  aspect  in  the
              unlikely  event  that  that  value is more readily
              available. For example, video  prepared  for  NTSC
              DVD  at 720x480 pixels intended for standard (4:3)
              display has a pixel aspect ratio of  8:9,  and  at
              352x240  a pixel aspect ratio of 10:11.  As above,
              `0' disables this field.

         3.2.3.  Behavior

         o    Initial volume: The video player has a volume con-
              trol that visitors can adjust, but this field will
              set a default volume. If  the  web  browser  flash
              plugin  is  permitted  to save values locally on a
              visitor's machine, then their adjustment  will  be
              saved,  and  will  be used rather than the default
              when they visit again (or reload the page).

         o    Play on load: This will cause the video (or audio)
              to  begin playing as soon as the player program is
              loaded. When this is not set, the player waits for
              the play button.

         o    Loop  play:  This  will  cause  the medium to play
              again from the beginning each time it ends.   When
              this  is  not  set, the media plays once, and then
              pauses.

         o    Hide control bar initially: This  will  cause  the
              control bar to hide a few seconds after the player
              loads (e.g., so that it does not obscure  an  ini-
              tial  image). Note that this also changes the con-
              trol bar behavior in general: the  bar  will  show
              whenever  mouse  movement  is  detected within the
              embedded window, and hide  again  when  there  has
              been  no  mouse  movement for a few seconds.  When
              this is not set, the control bar is  left  showing
              when  the  player  loads, and thereafter is always
              shown when the mouse is within the  embedded  win-
              dow,  and  is  always  hidden  when  the  mouse is
              detected leaving the window  (when  the  mouse  is
              moved  out  of the player window with rapid motion









                                 -7-


              the browser plugin often fails to deliver a `mouse
              has  left'  event to the player program, so hiding
              the bar is not always reliable).

         o    Hide and disable control bar: Enable this  if  the
              media should play through without interruption.

         o    Allow full screen: This enables a control bar but-
              ton that will place the video in full-screen mode.

         o    Control bar Height (20-50): The control bar height
              can  be  adjusted  with this. Actually, there is a
              fixed number precompiled sizes in the player bina-
              ries  that  are  distributed with the package, and
              this field causes the nearest size to be selected.
              If the WordPress host's PHP configuration includes
              the Ming extension, then you may select an  option
              on  the  SWFPut configuration page called "Dynamic
              SWF generation".  This produces the  video  player
              on  the  fly,  and  in this case the value of this
              field builds the control bar at the requested size
              rather than using a near match.


    3.3.  The Widget

         The  player can also be used as a widget.  The "Appear-
    ance" menu "Widgets" item should produce the "Widgets"  page
    which,  after  installation  of  SWFPut, should show "SWFPut
    Flash Video" under "Available Widgets". After dragging  this
    to  a  widget  area the setup form should display (click the
    arrow near the title if necessary). The  widget's  form  has
    the  same  items  described  under  "Form  Sections"  above,
    although this form is not displayed in  the  three  separate
    sections  and does not have the buttons near the top.  There
    is one additional item at the top of the widget form: a text
    field  named "Widget title".  Not surprisingly, the contents
    of that field will be displayed as a title above the  widget
    on the pages that include the particular widget area used.

         The description under "Pixel Width x Height" above men-
    tioned the maximum column widths set by the theme's CSS, and
    how  the  video  window width might be limited by the those.
    The same applies to widget areas, but the maximum  width  is
    likely  much  less than that in the posts area. These fields
    have defaults in the widget form that have been useful  with
    the  themes  distributed with WordPress, but the user should
    certainly do some testing along with the chosen theme.
