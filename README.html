<p align="center"><i>Ed Hynan
&lt;edhynan@gmail.com&gt;</i></p>

<p>This &lsquo;README&rsquo; serves as the main
documentation for the <b>SWFPut</b> <i>WordPress</i> plugin,
and as the conventional &lsquo;README&rsquo; as well.</p>

<h2>1. What is it?
<a name="1. What is it?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is a plugin for
<i>WordPress</i>. It provides video player programs for the
HTML video element and the flash plugin, and the means to
configure the players with video sources and playback
attributes. There are two separate components: the video
players, and the <i>WordPress</i> plugin proper. The video
players are delivered to site visitors by the plugin as
either HTML5 video with a flash plugin program as fallback
content, or inversely as flash video primary content with
HTML5 video elements for fallback. The former arrangement is
the default (as of version 2.1), but there is an option to
enable the latter arrangement if flash is preferred. It is
not necessary to provide for both types, one or the other
type may be left out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Video objects may be placed in
posts and pages, or in the widget areas supported by your
theme (i.e., the plugin includes a widget). Video is placed
in posts and pages with a <i>shortcode</i>; if you do not
know what a shortcode is, or do not want to deal with them,
that&rsquo;s no problem. (In fact, it is preferable that the
shortcodes <i>not</i> be hand-edited, and they will not be
discussed in detail here.) The plugin adds to the post/page
editor interfaces a button to insert video at the cursor,
and an easy to use dialog-type setup interface similar to
that used by <i>WordPress</i> core media, and also a full
featured form in a &ldquo;metabox&rdquo; with additional
advanced settings to setup and add, or edit, or delete video
objects. The video widget has a similar full featured form
for setup.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Video in posts may be displayed
in the <i>WordPress</i> visual editor, if the default visual
editor is used. If the default visual editor has been
changed, for example by a plugin, the video display in the
editor will probably not work. If there are problems, video
display in the editor may be disabled on the <b>SWFPut</b>
settings page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> does not depend on
<i>JavaScript</i> on the front end, but it is used for the
HTML5 video player, and for proper resizing of the video
display area. If <i>JavaScript</i> is not available, HTML5
video will have the interface provided by the web browser,
and the flash video will be largely unaffected (it only uses
<i>JavaScript</i> to check whether it is running on a mobile
platform). &ldquo;Responsive&rdquo; display resizing will
not be possible if <i>JavaScript</i> is not available, so
reasonable dimensions should be given in the setup form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>SWFPut</b> flash video
player has been coded to work well with the free
<i>Gnash</i> web browser plugin, as well as the closed
binary-only proprietary version in common use. As of this
writing, <i>Gnash</i> does not handle <b>MP4</b> files well,
even though it handles H.264 video and AAC audio if they are
in an FLV container file. Therefore, it is a good idea to
prepare FLV files for flash if you can.</p>

<h2>2. Building From the Source
<a name="2. Building From the Source"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is distributed
from the <i>WordPress</i> plugin repository as a <i>ZIP</i>
archive ready for installation on a <i>WordPress</i> site.
Therefore, there is no need to build the plugin before
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(You may skip forward to the
<b>Usage</b> section if you don&rsquo;t intend to modify the
player or plugin.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All necessary sources are
included in the distributed archive, but the necessary build
tools are not. The plugin is maintained with a POSIX
makefile, which in turn expects a POSIX Bourne shell.
Additional requirements are the <i>PHP</i> command-line
interface with the <i>Ming</i> extension to build the flash
video player, <i>PERL</i> packages to minify
<i>JavaScript</i>, <i>GNU</i> gettext for localization
sources, <i>GNU</i> groff (and a small C program) to make
the forms of this document, the portable <i>Info-ZIP</i> zip
command to make the archive, and various POSIX tools such as
sed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual plugin is composed of
<i>PHP</i> code, and does not require compilation or link
editing. The flash video player is a compiled program, but a
binary is included in the installable package so that use
does not require compilation by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Makefile default target
builds as necessary and then creates the ZIP file. The
Makefile is the build documentation.</p>

<h2>3. Usage
<a name="3. Usage"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> installs an item
under the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu named &ldquo;SWFPut
Plugin&rdquo;. Selecting that should produce the
plugin&rsquo;s configuration page. The configuration page
includes optional verbose help, and so it will not be
described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the post and page editors,
the plugin adds a button, labelled &ldquo;Add SWFPut
Video,&rdquo; next to the &ldquo;Add Media&rdquo; button.
This will insert a placeholder video at the cursor position.
When selected, a pencil button will appear, which invokes a
graphical setup dialog. This dialog is expected to be easy
and intuitive, so it is not elaborated on here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> also adds an
interactive form in a new metabox with the title
&ldquo;SWFPut Video&rdquo;. This form has advanced settings
not available in the graphical dialog. Directly under the
title is a row of buttons. Under the row of buttons, the
bulk of the form is placed in three sections entitled
&ldquo;Media&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dimensions&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Behavior&rdquo;. The title bar of each section has a
button that will hide or show that section, which might help
if the height of the form is greater than that of the
display.</p>

same as the display size of the video to be played, but the
appearance will be best if the <i>aspect</i> of the
player&rsquo;s display is the same as the display aspect of
the video. For example, with a video of a size of
400&times;300 setting these to fields to 320&times;240 would

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">These
dimensions are not fixed unless scripts are disabled in the
browser. Where scripting is available, the video display
area is resized in concert with changes that the browser
applies to the surrounding elements. This is particularly
important on mobile platforms, where the browser will
probably make extreme size adjustments for the small display
size. This &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; behavior will depend on
the current theme being responsive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful because a browser might also receive some of the
video frames, and so it may display one frame as a
&lsquo;poster.&rsquo; (Whether a frame displayed this way is
suitable is not certain.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">If
&ldquo;none&rdquo; is selected the browser will not fetch
any of the video until it is played, and so without an
initial image, the video region on the page will be solid
black until played.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">The
&ldquo;auto&rdquo; selection should be avoided unless you
know what it does and that you need it. This is because with
&ldquo;auto&rdquo; the browser may choose to fetch the
entire video even before the visitor actively plays the
video. Video files can be quite large, and a large
unsolicited download might be unkind to your site&rsquo;s
visitors; it might even cause a visitor additional charges
depending on their connection service. Also consider your
server and network load.</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">The flash
player does not have similar attributes, but will behave
similarly with regard to an initial image: if one was not
set, and the preload option is not &ldquo;none,&rdquo; then
the player will start playback and let it advance for a
small random period, and then pause playback, leaving a
visible frame to act as a &lsquo;poster.&rsquo;</p>

plugin is permitted to save values locally on a

saved, and will be used rather than the default when they
visit again (or reload the page). User settings are not
saved for the HTML5 video player presently.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">Above, it was
stated that if scripting is not available in the web
browser, HTML5 video will have the default appearance and
behavior provided by the web browser. The play on load
option will not be in effect in that case, because while the
video element can take an autoplay attribute, that cannot
reliably work with the scripted HTML5 player since it might
begin before the script gains control of the video
element.</p>

seconds after the player loads (e.g., so that it does not
obscure an initial image). Note that this also changes the
control bar behavior in general: the bar will show whenever
mouse movement is detected within the embedded window, and
hide again when there has been no mouse movement for a few
seconds.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-top: 1em">When this is
not set, the control bar is left showing when the player
loads, and thereafter is always shown when the mouse is
within the embedded window, and is always hidden when the
mouse is <i>detected</i> leaving the window (when the mouse
is moved out of the player window with rapid motion the
browser or plugin often fails to deliver a &lsquo;mouse has
left&rsquo; event to the player program, so hiding the bar
is not always reliable).</p>

also by usability on mobile platforms. Test, please.</p></td></tr>

<h3>3.3. The Widget
<a name="3.3. The Widget"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The player can also be used as a
widget. The &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; menu
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; item should produce the
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; page which, after installation of
<b>SWFPut</b>, should show &ldquo;<b>SWFPut Video
Player</b>&rdquo; under &ldquo;<b>Available
Widgets</b>&rdquo;. After dragging this to a widget area the
setup form should display (click the arrow near the title if
necessary). The widget&rsquo;s form has the same items
described under &ldquo;<b>Form Sections</b>&rdquo; above,
although this form is not displayed in the three separate
sections and does not have the buttons near the top. There
is one additional item at the top of the widget form: a text
field named &ldquo;Widget title&rdquo;. Not surprisingly,
the contents of that field will be displayed as a title
above the widget on the pages that include the particular
widget area used.</p>
