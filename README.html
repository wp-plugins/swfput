<p align="center"><i>Ed Hynan
&lt;edhynan@gmail.com&gt;</i></p>

<p>This &lsquo;README&rsquo; serves as the main
documentation for the <b>SWFPut</b> <i>WordPress</i> plugin,
and as the conventional &lsquo;README&rsquo; as well.</p>

<h2>1. What is it?
<a name="1. What is it?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is a plugin for
<i>WordPress</i>. It provides video player programs for the
flash plugin and and the HTML video element, and the means
to configure the players with video sources and playback
attributes. There are two separate components: the video
players, and the <i>WordPress</i> plugin proper. The video
players are delivered to site visitors by the plugin as
either HTML5 video with a flash plugin program as fallback
content, or inversely as flash video primary content with
HTML5 video elements for fallback. The former arrangement is
the default (as of version 2.1), but there is an option to
enable the latter arrangement if flash is preferred. It is
not necessary to provide for both types, one or the other
type may be left out.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Video objects may be placed in
posts and pages, or in the widget areas supported by your
theme (i.e., the plugin includes a widget). Video is placed
in posts and pages with a <i>shortcode</i>; if you do not
know what a shortcode is, or do not want to deal with them,
that&rsquo;s no problem. (In fact, it is preferable that the
shortcodes <i>not</i> be hand-edited, and they will not be
discussed in detail here.) The plugin adds to the post/page
editor interfaces a full featured form to setup and add, or
edit, or delete video objects, so the user does not need to
be troubled with shortcodes. The video widget has a similar
full featured form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Video in posts may be displayed
in the <i>WordPress</i> visual editor, if the default visual
editor is used. If the default visual editor has been
changed, for example by a plugin, the video display in the
editor will probably not work. If there are problems, video
display in the editor may be disabled on the <b>SWFPut</b>
settings page.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> does not depend on
<i>JavaScript</i> on the front end, but it is used for the
HTML5 video player, and for proper resizing of the video
display area. If <i>JavaScript</i> is not available, HTML5
video will have the interface provided by the web browser,
and the flash video will be largely unaffected (it only uses
<i>JavaScript</i> to check whether it is running on a mobile
platform). &ldquo;Responsive&rdquo; display resizing will
not be possible if <i>JavaScript</i> is not available, so
reasonable dimensions should be given in the setup form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The <b>SWFPut</b> flash video
player has been coded to work well with the free
<i>Gnash</i> web browser plugin, as well as the closed
binary-only proprietary version in common use. As of this
writing, <i>Gnash</i> does not handle <b>MP4</b> files well,
even though it handles H.264 video and AAC audio if they are
in an FLV container file. Therefore, it is a good idea to
prepare FLV files for flash if you can.</p>

<h2>2. Building From the Source
<a name="2. Building From the Source"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is distributed
from the <i>WordPress</i> plugin repository as a <i>ZIP</i>
archive ready for installation on a <i>WordPress</i> site.
Therefore, there is no need to build the plugin before
use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(You may skip forward to the
<b>Usage</b> section if you don&rsquo;t intend to modify the
player or plugin.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">All necessary sources are
included in the distributed archive, but the necessary build
tools are not. The plugin is maintained with a POSIX
makefile, which in turn expects a POSIX Bourne shell.
Additional requirements are the <i>PHP</i> command-line
interface with the <i>Ming</i> extension to build the flash
video player, <i>PERL</i> packages to minify
<i>JavaScript</i>, <i>GNU</i> gettext for localization
sources, <i>GNU</i> groff (and a small C program) to make
the forms of this document, the portable <i>Info-ZIP</i> zip
command to make the archive, and various POSIX tools such as
sed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual plugin is composed of
<i>PHP</i> code, and does not require compilation or link
editing. The flash video player is a compiled program, but a
binary is included in the installable package so that use
does not require compilation by the user.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Makefile default target
builds as necessary and then creates the ZIP file. The
Makefile is the build documentation.</p>

<h2>3. Usage
<a name="3. Usage"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> installs an item
under the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu named &ldquo;SWFPut
Plugin&rdquo;. Selecting that should produce the
plugin&rsquo;s configuration page. The configuration page
includes optional verbose help, and so it will not be
described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">In the post and page editors,
the plugin adds an interactive form in a new metabox with
the title &ldquo;SWFPut Video&rdquo;. Directly under the
title is a row of buttons. Under the row of buttons, the
bulk of the form is placed in three sections entitled
&ldquo;Media&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dimensions&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Behavior&rdquo;. The title bar of each section has a
button that will hide or show that section, which might help
if the height of the form is greater than that of the
display.</p>

player&rsquo;s display is the same as the display aspect of
the video. For example, if set for a video with a size of
400&times;300, then setting these to fields to 320&times;240
would look good (the width:height ratio is the same). In any
case, the player will scale the video to fit within its
display, but it maintains the aspect ratio, so horizontal or
vertical black (unused) areas will be visible if the aspect
ratios do not match. These dimensions are not fixed unless
scripts are disabled. Where scripting is available, the
video display area is resized in concert with changes that
the browser applies to the surrounding elements. This is
particularly important on mobile platforms, where the
browser will probably make extreme size adjustments for the
small display size (This behavior might depend on the
current theme).</p></td></tr>

<h3>3.3. The Widget
<a name="3.3. The Widget"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The player can also be used as a
widget. The &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; menu
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; item should produce the
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; page which, after installation of
<b>SWFPut</b>, should show &ldquo;<b>SWFPut Video
Player</b>&rdquo; under &ldquo;<b>Available
Widgets</b>&rdquo;. After dragging this to a widget area the
setup form should display (click the arrow near the title if
necessary). The widget&rsquo;s form has the same items
described under &ldquo;<b>Form Sections</b>&rdquo; above,
although this form is not displayed in the three separate
sections and does not have the buttons near the top. There
is one additional item at the top of the widget form: a text
field named &ldquo;Widget title&rdquo;. Not surprisingly,
the contents of that field will be displayed as a title
above the widget on the pages that include the particular
widget area used.</p>
