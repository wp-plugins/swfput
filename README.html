<p>This &lsquo;README&rsquo; serves as the main
documentation for the <b>SWFPut</b> <i>WordPress</i> plugin,
and as the conventional &lsquo;README&rsquo; as well.</p>

<h2>1. What is it?
<a name="1. What is it?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is a plugin for
the popular <i>WordPress</i> weblog software. It provides a
video player program for the flash plugin and the means to
configure an instance with a video source and playback
attributes. There are two separate components: the flash
video player, and the <i>WordPress</i> plugin proper. The
video player is delivered to site visitors by the plugin in
the traditional &lt;object ...&gt; block with the necessary
arguments. Flash video objects may be placed in posts and
pages, or in the widget areas supported by your theme (i.e.,
the plugin includes a widget). Video is placed in posts and
pages with a <i>shortcode</i>; if you do not know what a
shortcode is, or do not want to deal with them, that&rsquo;s
no problem. (In fact, it is preferable that the shortcodes
<i>not</i> be hand-edited, and they will not be discussed in
detail here.) The plugin adds to the administrative
interface a full featured form to setup and add, or edit, or
delete video objects, so the user does not need to be
troubled with shortcodes (they will be visible in the
editor; you will get used to them). The flash video widget
has a similar full featured form.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The plugin does not add any
<i>JavaScript</i> to the pages generated for your visitors,
which might be helpful if you try to keep your pages useful
to those who disable JavaScript in their browsers. (Such
visitors might need to explicitly enable the flash web
browser plugin, but that is another, unavoidable, issue.)
JavaScript is used in the administrative interface for the
forms and manipulation of shortcodes in the editor; but of
course you must have JavaScript enabled when you log in to
your <i>WordPress</i> site &mdash; this does not affect your
visitors.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(Note that the <b>SWFPut</b>
video player has been coded to work well with the free
<i>Gnash</i> web browser plugin, as well as the closed
binary-only proprietary version in common use. As of this
writing, <i>Gnash</i> does not handle <b>MP4</b> files well,
even though it handles H.264 video and AAC audio if they are
in an FLV container file.)</p>

<h2>2. Building From the Source
<a name="2. Building From the Source"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> is distributed as
a <i>ZIP</i> archive prepared for installation on a
<i>WordPress</i> site with the &ldquo;Add New&rdquo; item
under the &ldquo;Plugins&rdquo; menu. Therefore, there is no
need to build the package before use.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">(You may skip forward to the
<b>Usage</b> section if you don&rsquo;t intend to modify the
player or plugin.)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The actual plugin is composed of
<i>PHP</i> code, and JavaScript for the administrative
parts, and neither of those requires compilation or link
editing. The flash video player is a compiled program, but
binaries are included in the installable package so that use
does not require compilation by the user. Of course, the
source code is included and the binaries may be built if
necessary (or desired). Compiling the flash program will
require the <i>Ming</i> PHP extension. See the files
<tt>Makefile</tt>, <tt>mingtest/mingput.php</tt>, and
<tt>mingtest/mainact.inc.php</tt> if you wish to learn to
build the player.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">If you wish to change the
JavaScript code, edit <tt>js/formxed.dev.js</tt>, rather
than <tt>js/formxed.js</tt>. The latter is merely a
&lsquo;minified&rsquo; version of the former; see
<tt>Makefile</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This file (README*) is built
with the <i>GNU</i> roff <i>groff</i> with <i>ms</i> macros;
see <tt>docs/Makefile</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The Makefiles require a
<i>Unix</i>-like or <i>POSIX</i> system. The default target
builds as necessary and then creates the ZIP file.</p>

<h2>3. Usage
<a name="3. Usage"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A logged in session is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SWFPut</b> installed will add
an item under the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu named
&ldquo;SWFPut Plugin&rdquo;. Selecting that should produce
the plugin&rsquo;s configuration page. The configuration
page includes optional verbose help, and so it will not be
described here.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">When editing posts or pages,
below the editor the plugin will have placed an interactive
form with the title &ldquo;SWFPut Flash Video
Shortcode&rdquo;. Directly under the title is a row of
buttons. Under the row of buttons, the bulk of the form is
placed in three sections entitled &ldquo;Media&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dimensions&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Behavior&rdquo;. The
title bar of each section has a button that will hide or
show that section, which might help if the height of the
form is greater than that the display.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>Pixel Width &times;
Height</b>: set these to the desired size of the
player&rsquo;s embedded window. This does not need to be the
same as the display size of the video to be played, but the
appearance will be best if the <i>aspect</i> of the
player&rsquo;s display is the same as the display aspect of
the video. For example, if set for a video with a size of
400&times;300, then setting these to fields to 320&times;240
would look good (the width:height ratio is the same). In any
case, the player will scale the video to fit within its
display, but it maintains the aspect ratio, so horizontal or
vertical black (unused) areas will be visible if the aspect
ratios do not match. It is also important to note that the
browser will (probably) honor a maximum width for a page
column set in <i>CSS</i>, and force the browser&rsquo;s
flash plugin to display at a smaller width than the user
specified. For example, if you set these fields to
640&times;480, but the column in which posts appear has a
width of 600, the display would be at 600&times;480. In such
a case, you might try 600&times;450 to maintain the aspect
so that the video matches display size. The above assumes a
4:3 aspect; you would use the correct numbers, of
course.</p> </td></tr>

not match its intended display aspect. With this check
enabled, the video player will force display at 4:3 ratio if
the video dimensions match one of the DVD-Video pixel sizes.

option on the <b>SWFPut</b> configuration page called
&ldquo;Dynamic SWF generation&rdquo;. This produces the
video player on the fly, and in this case the value of this
field builds the control bar at the requested size rather
than using a near match.</p></td></tr>

<h3>3.3. The Widget
<a name="3.3. The Widget"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The player can also be used as a
widget. The &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; menu
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; item should produce the
&ldquo;Widgets&rdquo; page which, after installation of
<b>SWFPut</b>, should show &ldquo;<b>SWFPut Flash
Video</b>&rdquo; under &ldquo;<b>Available
Widgets</b>&rdquo;. After dragging this to a widget area the
setup form should display (click the arrow near the title if
necessary). The widget&rsquo;s form has the same items
described under &ldquo;<b>Form Sections</b>&rdquo; above,
although this form is not displayed in the three separate
sections and does not have the buttons near the top. There
is one additional item at the top of the widget form: a text
field named &ldquo;Widget title&rdquo;. Not surprisingly,
the contents of that field will be displayed as a title
above the widget on the pages that include the particular
widget area used.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">The description under
&ldquo;<b>Pixel Width &times; Height</b>&rdquo; above
mentioned the maximum column widths set by the theme&rsquo;s
CSS, and how the video window width might be limited by the
those. The same applies to widget areas, but the maximum
width is likely much less than that in the posts area. These
fields have defaults in the widget form that have been
useful with the themes distributed with <i>WordPress</i>,
but the user should certainly do some testing along with the
chosen theme.</p>
